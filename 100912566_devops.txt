COMP 3104 DevOps is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field.
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to
business needs. COMP 3104 will provide a hands-on experience through the
implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies.

It will also examine ways in which companies have either lost or saved fortunes
with DevOps strategies. Learning about Amazon Web Services, Ansible, Docker and
Travis CI, students will become familiar with end-to-end deployment processes. 
They will also have their very own build pipeline which will allow them to 
push changes to a web app in the wild at the stroke of a key.
