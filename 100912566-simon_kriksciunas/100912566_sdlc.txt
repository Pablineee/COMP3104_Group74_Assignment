Using DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to
ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes, catch errors before they 
produce some sort of unintended behavior and keep transparency & 
communication heightened across all teams. 
Looking at the software development lifecycle through the lens of 
a DevOps Engineer will produce a more informed and qualified developer.

DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between development, operations, and 
other stakeholders, reducing friction and misunderstandings.
Teams share responsibility for the entire lifecycle of an application, 
promoting a sense of ownership.
CI/CD pipelines automate the integration and testing processes, 
allowing for frequent code changes without compromising quality.
DevOps aligns well with Agile practices, 
enabling teams to respond quickly to changes in requirements and market demands.
